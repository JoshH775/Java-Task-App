# Java Task Manager

This is a simple task management application built in a few hours to showcase my Java experience. It uses Spring Boot to provide a REST API and SQLite as the database, with dependencies managed through Maven. The application uses a repository and model structure for straightforward data handling. The project is monolithic in nature, and uses Vite and Svelte with Typescript and tailwind, creating an effective and good-looking SPA frontend.

The Task Manager allows users to:
- Create tasks with a name, description, and priority.
- View tasks sorted by priority.
- Update or delete tasks.
